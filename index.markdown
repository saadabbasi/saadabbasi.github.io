## About me

<!-- I'm now a Research Scientist at [Samsung SAIT AI Lab Montreal](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/about/labs.do). I'm completing my PhD at the Machine Learning Research Group, [University of Guelph](https://uoguelph.ca/) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) (Ontario, Canada). My research interests lie at the intersection of graph neural networks (GNNs) and computer vision. 
My advisor is [Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/). In summer 2020, I interned at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in Montreal working with [â€ªAdriana Romero](https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor/) and Michal Drozdzal on [parameter prediction for neural networks](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ppuda). 
Before that, I interned at Mila working with [Eugene Belilovsky](http://eugenium.github.io/) and [Aaron Courville](https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/) on [visual compositional generalization](https://github.com/bknyaz/sgg). In 2018, I interned at SRI International with [Mohamed Amer](https://mohamedramer.com/), where I worked on [training GNNs on image superpixels](https://github.com/bknyaz/bmvc_2019).
Before starting my PhD in 2017, I worked on unsupervised learning and pretraining of neural networks, face, emotion and facial attributes recognition, and video recognition. -->

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Vision & Image Processing Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/) at the University of Waterloo. My research interests lie at the intersection of neural architecture search and latency estimation. In particular, I research and develop techniques to automatically discover efficient hardware-specific neural network architectures. I also bring forth significant optics experience which I gained during my Masters degree. My Masters degree revolved around developing a laser-based microscope for histopathology, real-time imaging and point image reconstruction.

I previously worked professionally as an embedded hardware/software engineer and transitioned to developing machine-vision based inspection systems. Please see my CV for my full breadth of expierence.
