## About me

<img src="assets/me.png" height="160" style="float:right; margin:5px 25px 5px 5px">

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Vision & Image Processing Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/) at the University of Waterloo. My research interests lie at the intersection of neural architecture search and latency estimation. In particular, I research and develop techniques to automatically discover efficient hardware-specific neural network architectures. I also bring forth significant optics experience which I gained during my Masters degree. My Masters degree revolved around developing a laser-based microscope for histopathology, real-time imaging and point image reconstruction.

I previously worked professionally as an embedded hardware/software engineer and transitioned to developing machine-vision based inspection systems. Please see my CV for my full breadth of expierence.
